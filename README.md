# Waste Not

## Purpose

* This is a project that revamps an existing shopping list application (client only). It has the enhancement of tracking purchased food items and providing notifications when the food is about to expire.

* Additionally this version has a backend so the application could be used across multiple devices.

* This is a transitional project for learning newer React syntax (hooks, effects, context). So there may be some refactoring between redux and react context. Currently the intention is to mainly use context for authentication status, use hooks for form controls, and use redux to store lists (nested objects).

* Accordingly with the above statement, this project may not apply all best practices for new react vs redux. It is a learning process.

## Dependencies

* PostgreSQL v11.5

* A PostgreSQL user should be defined as owner of the working database and defined in the server .env file (see .env.example)

* Webpack
